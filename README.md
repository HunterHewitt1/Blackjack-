### **_How To Get Started_**
The browser will prompt the player with a begin game button, after clicking, the dealer will deal 2 random cards to you and to the house. The player will have an option to hit (get drawn another card) or to stand with the current cards dealt. The dealer must hit untill the cards they have equal a value of at least 16. The hand that is closest to 21 wins.
